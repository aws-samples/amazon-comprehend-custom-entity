Why are @115714 sms going through at 70 characters a message instead of 160?!? No emojis involved either. Fix it cause this is absolute garbage. | @748692 Hey CK! It sounds like your phone is now sending messages in the Unicode UTF-16 character set instead of the GSM character set. UTF-16 limits you to 70 characters per message instead of the 160 for GSM because it uses more space for each character. -AC
"Why are @115714 sms going through at 70 characters a message instead of 160?!? No emojis involved either. Fix it cause this is absolute garbage. | @748692 letters, numbers, a few upper-case Greek letters, and a selection of common accented characters and punctuation (https://t.co/pXNzQfHNzA). If you've used anything else your phone will have switched to UTf-16 and hence reduced the number of characters per text. (2/2) -AC"
Why are @115714 sms going through at 70 characters a message instead of 160?!? No emojis involved either. Fix it cause this is absolute garbage. | @748692 This can either be a phone setting - possibly related to changing the phone's language or locale settings - or it can be due to using characters that aren't in the GSM character set. The GSM character set includes upper and lower case English (1/2) -AC
